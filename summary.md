# Analysis

From cube, make integrated mom 0,1,2 maps using the entire velocity extents of the outflows ().
Create two sets of data. with name irdxxxx_mom.fits

We integrate the SiO emisison a

## 4.0. Automated clustering with Dendrogram -- Troy
We integrate the SiO emisison a


## 4.1. SiO Spectra and Integrated Intensity Map
To identify the SiO emission features, use the 12 m array data only, 7 mm array only and the combined of 12m + 7m + ACA. 
We first look at SiO using the continuum maps of Sanhueza et al. 2020: if they are detected within the extend of these pixels, they will be label as dust associated SiO emission
Maybe this can be done automatically using dust map as a mask and just colvolve the SiO cube to that of dust, measure SiO spectra within the central or two beam.--> fraction of SiO gas in dust


We then look at SiO using the CO outflow map: if they are detected within the extend of these pixels, they will be label as outflow associated SiO emission. We sereach
Maybe this can be done automatically using outfloz map as a mask https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb81f/pdf
We label the rest of SiO emission as other SiO emission feature
We follow the procedure described below to identify CO outflows: (1) Using DS9,14 we inspect the position–position– velocity (PPV) data cubes of the CO emission to determine the velocity ranges of the blue- and redshifted components with respect to the cloud emission. (2) These velocity ranges are used to generate the velocity-integrated intensity maps (moment-0) for both blue- and redshifted components, which, in conjunction with the channel maps and the CO line profiles, are used to determine the direction of CO outflows. (3) The position–velocity (PV) diagram, which is cut along the identified CO outflow, combined with the channel maps and line profiles, is further used to carefully

# Analysis

## Spectral profile shapes/ narrow or wings?
## SiO Column Density
    Excitation cannot be that high > 10000 K so column density is around 10^12
    Separate SiO column density in jet/outflow and others
## SiO feature separations: highshock and lowshock
