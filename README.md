The idea is to cluster/segment image using an unsupervised learning method: Clustering: Hierachical Clustering: Dendrogram

 
 
Later it can be expanded to clustering based on geometry instead of signal. This is to say we decompose 2D or 3D images into Delaunay triangles using some already implemented algo.
